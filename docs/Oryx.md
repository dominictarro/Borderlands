# Oryx

Oryx dataset documentation and notes.

## Introduction

The Oryx dataset is a collection of visually-confirmed losses for the Russo-Ukrainian War. The dataset is maintained by an open source community and the Oryx moderators.

### Schema

The latest version of the losses can be found at `s3://tarro-borderlands/oryx/landing/latest.json`. The parent JSON object contains the `metadata` and `data` fields. The data fields contains a list of objects, each of which represents a confirmed loss.

Some fields came directly from the parsed Oryx page, and some were generated by Borderlands's Oryx processes.
