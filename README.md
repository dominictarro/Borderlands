## About

*Public access is temporarily unavailable while I develop the API.*

This project was started with the objective of making the Oryx's visually-confirmed losses for the Russo-Ukrainian War more accessible for analysis. While I am personally incurring the AWS costs, I greatly appreciate [donations](https://patreon.com/tarrodot?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link) to help support the maintenance and growth of this project. Borderlands was built such that others may replicate the system privately should they choose to do so.
